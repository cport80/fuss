	  <h3>FUSS Editing</h3>
	</div>
	<br/>
	<p class="paper">
	FUSS is just a text file which you can edit with any text editor. We may go on to release other versions as and when they are completed, such as 
	fuss-green.css or fuss-yellow.css with obvious changes to the defalut colour scheme. The base FUSS file contains helpful comments to help you get
	started with creating your very own FUSS file. In CSS, we add comments using
	<br/><br/>
	<font class="code">/* Anything between the *'s is a comment */</font>
	<br/><br/>
	When you're finished with your custom version, you can put it through a minimiser which will shrink the file, remove comments and make it quicker 
	for your visitors to download (remember not to overwrite your original source file when doing this).
	
	</p>
	<div class="well">
	FUSS is just the starting point for your web-projects. We encourage you to explore the fuss.css style-sheet, edit it and
	make it your own. Save your version with a new filename (e.g. fuss-myversion.css) and link to this in your HTML.
